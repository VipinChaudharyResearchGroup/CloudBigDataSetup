# Data Management

- Data Warehouse is a place where you store your data for analysis. It is a central repository of integrated data from one or more sources. It is used for reporting and data analysis. 

- Data Lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed. Data is stored in its raw format without any transformation. Data Lake is a centralized repository that can store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. 

- Data Lakehouse is a combination of Data Lake and Data Warehouse. It is a centralized repository that can store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.  


# Types of Data


Examples:
- Structured data, such as patient records, are better suited for traditional relational databases, in part because of the consistency and reliability of relational databases.

- Non-critical data about a customer's interactions with a business is an excellent fit for Hadoop. HDFS supports storing unstructured data in a manner that is scalable and accessible.
